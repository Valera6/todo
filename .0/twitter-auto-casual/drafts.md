# Trading & Music
```
We have much to learn from musicians

There are not more than a hundred trades in a life of discretionary trader, that matter. So why don't we spent hours optimising every atomic part of our execution?

It is not uncommon for a pianist to spend 1/10 of a day getting the sound of a single note just right. Have you ever gone through every trade in the orderbook that happened during the time you were participating? Have you ever spent 100 hours to capture an edge case common to your style of trading, and implement a forever-active automatic safeguard?

Few people do. And no matter what place they are in now, it is unreasonable for them not to succeed. Greatness is an option. If you are ready to sacrifice everything.
