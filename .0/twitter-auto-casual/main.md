# Overall structure
Have the stable posts remain at @ValerySakharov1
Start introducing half-automatic posting to #valeratrades. Main idea is to process real actionable signals, and then make them engaging by overlaying a naturally-seeming comment on top of them.


# Ideas
gotta pull the most successful bullish and bearish tweets; then have a cli command to bullpost or bearpost.

## Bonus points:
- adjust quality estimation by number of followers at the moment of publication
- make a script to enable some sort of "DCA", meaning to post random tweets of according directionality; providing target time period and the desireed frequency (default 30m)
