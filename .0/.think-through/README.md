# Think-throw
TODOs on thinks that require specifically mental comparative effort, not demanding anything but evaluation.

Idea is to diminish chance of procrastination by outlining exactly what could be done in each state of mind.

# Style
1. A `.md` file for every state

inside the file the numbered list of the problems, as follows:
```md
1. problem numero uno
Maybe do a)
Or maybe do b)
1. problem numero duo
Considerations for this problem now.
```
