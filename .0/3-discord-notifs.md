They have this thing where you can kill it and they're running in the bakcground or something like that.


I want to be able to simply activate that and then be able to no less simply bring back the discord when needed. Probably just with bind on d or Shift+d.

Only problem I want to work around is that discord window should be always in the same place. I want to have either frozen frame either black screen on its place when discord is killed.

Also, I think I'd do the same with tg, but only after my todo system is bettter than anything telegram can provide in that regard.


// bonus points for making wrap around words work properly in nvim.
