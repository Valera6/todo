if Elon or Musk in the tweet, we reroute it to the musk-specific request. Normally these things will be picked up by aggregators. They will say something like "Elon Musk changed his twitter location to 'X√ê'", and we reroute this to a special request that will inquire if anything in this is connected to DOGE and if so, whether it is positive.
Equally so, if work "Twiitter" is encountered, we're all the same sending it the same way, only now we're asking the question of whether the action twitter as a company took is a diriect endorsement of crypto.
Probably, similar is nice to do for Tesla, (but exclude any sales of items with crypto as payment option, as this is not news). If we get some dog-shaped item, or far-reaching crypto endorsment on the company level, effect will be substantial.
On the contrary, I don't think we should be closely following SpaceX, as we're gonna be the last to act on a blow up of a rocket.

It may seem that frankly the only chance we have is with the announcement promises
We could heavily optimize for it
That might be the very right move
