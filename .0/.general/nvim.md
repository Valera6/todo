# Comments
## Todo
- add search for `todo!()`

- add option to write `TODO{!*n}: \` to show the line underneath it in the quickfix

## Hide
- [ ] fix comments being white in the dark mode

- [ ] roll and unroll all comments blocks on this. So anything that is at least 2 comments in a row, we want to roll, and make invisible.

# General
redirect explicit `d` command from visual mode and its `dd` brother  to store the thing in a different register from using <BS>
// maybe in a 'd' register?
