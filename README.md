All notes, todos and life stats tracking in one place; organised with nothing but markdown and nvim

## Style
It's just dumb. I'm trying to make it "simpler" by adding extensions to some of the functions, like `tadd` -> `taddo`, where 'o' is for "open". Meaning, we do the exact same thing, but open the corresponding file after. 

## Notes
Only the notes on the projects without a dedicated git repo should appear here.
